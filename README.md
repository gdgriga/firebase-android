## What's This
An Android client for Google's [Firebase][2] project. This app was built for [GDG Riga's][1] Firebase Workshop event which took place on 27th of August 2016 in Riga, Latvia. Follow this guide to get started with [Firebase][2] development on Android.

## What You'll Need
* Device with Android 2.3+ and Google Play Services 9.4.0+
* Android Studio 1.5+
* Google Play Services SDK

## What We'll Build
A sprint board (something like [Trello][3]) that utilizes most of the Firebase features.

## Getting Started
To skip this step, do:

    git checkout -f 1/firebase-setup

Note that you'll still need the google-services.json file to be placed in app folder.

First thing you'll need is a Firebase project. You can make one [here][4]. Then, follow [this guide][5] to add Firebase to the app.
